# Work Day Planner

- I was tasked with creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying the starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

- When the planner is opened by the user, it displays the current day at the top of the calendar. 

- When the user scrolls down, they are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. 

- When the user clicks into a timeblock, they are able to enter an event. The user then clicks the "save" button for that specific timeblock to save the text for that event in local storage. The user can then refresh the page and still be presented with their saved events. 

- The [Moment.js] (https://momentjs.com/) library is utilized to work with the date and time. The documentation concentrates on using Moment.js within the browser.
